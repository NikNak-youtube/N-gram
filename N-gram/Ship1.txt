The most contemporary non-Chinese record of the expeditions is an untitled and anonymous annalistic account of the then-ruling Ras?lid dynasty of Yemen, compiled in the years 1439–1440. It reports the arrival of Chinese ships in 1419, 1423, and 1432, which approximately correspond to Zheng He's fifth, sixth, and seventh voyages. The 1419 arrival is described thus: Arrival of Dragon-ships [mar?kib al-zank] in the protected harbour city [of Aden] and with them the messengers of the ruler of China with brilliant gifts for his Majesty, the Sultan al-Malik al-N?sir in the month of l’Hijja in the year 821 [January 1419]. His Majesty, the Sultan al-Malik al-N?si?’s in the Protected D?r al-Jund send the victorious al-Maha??a to accept the brilliant gifts of the ruler of China. It was a splendid present consisting of all manner of rarities [tuhaf], splendid Chinese silk cloth woven with gold [al-thiy?b al-kamkh?t al-mudhahhabah], top quality musk, storax [al-??d al-rat?] and many kinds of chinaware vessels, the present being valued at twenty thousand Chinese mithq?l [93.6 kg gold]. It was accompanied by the Q?di Waj?h al-D?n ?Abd al-Rahman b. Jumay. And this was on 26 Muharram in the year 822 [March 19, 1419]. His majesty, the Sultan al-Malik al-N?sir ordered that the Envoy of the ruler of China [rusul s?hib al-S??n] returned with gifts of his own, including many rare, with frankincense-wrapped coral trees, wild animals such as oryx, wild ass, thousands of wild lion and tame cheetahs. And they travelled in the company of Q?di Waj?h al-D?n ?Abd al-Rahman b. Jumay out of the sheltered harbour of Aden in the month of Safar of the year 822 [March 1419].
